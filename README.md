gia: Genomic Interval Arithmetic

## Summary

This is a work-in-progress CLI for the [`bedrs`](https://github.com/noamteyssier/bedrs)
interval library.

It aims to replicate all the functions of [`bedtools`](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
but leverage the speed and portability of a rust-based stack.
