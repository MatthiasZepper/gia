# Introduction

## GIA: Genome Interval Arithmetic

`gia` is a free and open-source command-line tool for highly efficient
and scalable set operations on genomic interval data.

It is inspired by the open source command-line tools [`bedtools`](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [`bedops`](https://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and aims to be a drop-in
replacement to both.

`gia` is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and distributed via [`cargo`](https://rustup.rs/).
It is a command-line tool built on top of [`bedrs`](https://crates.io/crates/bedrs),
a separate and abstracted genomic interval library.
